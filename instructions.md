# soundpack
This is a soundpack for the j33tGhost cheat created by me.

# Instructions
Navigate to the Autoclicker Menu and then click on "Sounds". There, click on the three periods, and an openfiledialog will show.
Now, select the sound you prefer. If preferred, you may play all of the sounds in the sound menu. If you want to add a new
sound, simply drag the sound to the soundpack folder, and select it from there (or, if you desire from another location).
